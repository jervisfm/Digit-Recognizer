About
=======
This is a handwritten digit recognizer that uses a nearest neighbor classifier to recognize handwritten single digits. 


Files:
=======
readDATA.m          ->  reads in the MNIST dataset. The data should be in a subdirectory called 'MNIST'
loadHndDATA.m       ->  reads in the manually collected images. These images should in a subdirectory called 'img'
procTD.m            ->  Processes the MNIST training set and bounds the images to 28x28 bounding box.
proc.m              ->  Processes a test image and bounds it in a 28x28 bounding box.
approach1.m         ->  Does classification using raw features
approach2.m         ->  Binds digits to a bounding box and then applies nearest neighbor classifer
approach3.m         ->  Does nearest neighbor classification with K = 3.
extract.m           ->  Finds the bounding box in an image with a digit and returns that bounding box.
binarze.m           ->  Converts an image to a binary image of 0s and 1s.
pca.m               ->  Implements PCA
dopca.m             ->  Tests PCA apporach to see how well it does. 
darken.m            ->  Converts white background in a image to a black background. 
test.m				->	Tests nearest neighbor classifier on MNIST dataset. Currently set to test all 10,000 images; edit sizeTest for smaller size.
testk.m				->	Tests k-nearest neighbor classifier on MNIST dataset. Set to test 2,000 images; edit sizeTest for different size.
						Takes one parameter, k.


Before Running
==============
Make sure that the directory structure is as follows: 

1) MNIST/ : This directory should contain all of the MNIST raw data set and it should be in extracted form. You can download the dataset from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
2) img/   : This should contain the 200 scanned images.

If you do not have this structure, you will get a file not found error as the scripts expects the data to be in these locations.


MNIST Dataset
===================
For the classification of the MNIST dataset, the relevant files are :
test.m, and testk.m.

When you run these you scripts you will get a current estimate of how well the classifier is doing on test data. 
Refers to the files description above to infer what each file does and for more details please see the report of Varun Ravishankar. 


Independent Dataset
===================
For the classification of the independently gathered dataset, the relevant files are :
approach1.m ; approach2.m and approach3.m and dopca.m.

When you run these you scripts you will get a current estimate of how well the classifier is doing on test data. Also note that
the scripts output estimated time of completion when carrying out computationally intensive task that can take a while to run. 
Refers to the files description above to infer what each file does and for more details please see the report of Jervis Muindi.
